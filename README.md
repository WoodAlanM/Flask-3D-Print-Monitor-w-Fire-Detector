This is a developing idea for a 3D print monitor that I can use on my home network to watch my 3D printers from another place in the house.

In addition, I am implementing a fire detecting functionality so that I can use the same system for monitoring my laser.  I used an image classifying program to develop a model for the program to compare the video feed against.  So far, tests have been successful.
